                    <p><span>T</span>he 2021 is the 200th anniversary since Fyodor Dostoevsky’s birth. A great Russian writer, who is famous world-wide for deep immersions into human psychology in his novels, was born on November 11, 1821. Today we will discuss one of his most famous novels.<br><br>

                    The plot of Crime and Punishment is widely-known. A poor student murders an old pawnbroker woman with an axe in order to rob her and runs away. Since then he is constantly haunted by pangs of conscience, which is why eventually he turns himself in to the police. But is it all there is to it?<br><br>
                    
                    Rodion Raskolnikov is a brilliant, yet conflicted young man living in condition of extreme poverty. Tired of small and unsuccessful fight for existence he falls into tormenting apathy, and during this apathy the thought of a crime emerges in his mind and ripens day by day.<br><br>
                    
                    The surroundings play a major role in the shaping of idea process. Dostoevsky had always had two Saint-Petersburgs. One is the city created by genius architects, the Saint-Petersburg of Palace Embankment and Palace Square, which amazes us with its beauty and greatness. The other includes houses without the architecture at all, loads of taverns and pubs, dirt and dust on the streets, the persistent scent of alcohol and ditch water, drunk people walking around in broad daylight. Being a close witness to people’s struggles, Raskolnikov comes to conclusion that the only way out of this circle of poverty is revolution. Revolution against morality that keeps people silent.<br><br>
                    
                    The student has a “theory”, a certain position on the way the world functions. In his opinion, all people are divided into two groups: ordinary and extraordinary.<br><br>
                    
                    “I only believe in my leading idea that men are in general divided by a law of nature into two categories, inferior (ordinary), that is, so to say, material that serves only to reproduce its kind, and men who have the gift or the talent to utter a new word.”<br><br>
                    
                    According to his theory, extraordinary people have the right to transgress the law, to commit a crime if their actions serve the common good.<br><br>
                    
                    “Out of desperation and confusion he yields to some unfinished ideas that fill the air in the city and decides to get out of his wretched situation at once by committing a crime. He decides to kill her, to rob her in order to help his mother, who lives in the country, and to release his sister, who works as a servant in the landowner’s house and is forced to tolerate harassment from the said landowner. And then be honest and fulfill his duties as a law-abiding and selfless citizen for the rest of his life, which, of course, will make up for this crime, if removing one cynical, unscrupulous, wicked crone can even be called a crime”, Dostoevsky described his character.<br><br>
                    
                    Raskolnikov carries out his plan, but accidentally kills the old woman’s sister Lizaveta, who walked into the room at inappropriate time. This is another beautiful move by Dostoevsky, by which he questions the whole validity of Raskolnikov’s theory, who killed with a supposedly “bad” person someone innocent and kind.<br><br>
                    
                    By pure accident Raskolnikov did not leave any traces and managed to safely return home after pursuing his plan. However, his nature revolted against such a horrible action resulting in Rodion’s fever and hallucination. The author purposely does not leave any evidence that can give Roskolnikov away leaving it all to his conscience.<br><br>
                    
                    As envisioned by the author, the reader knows the culprit from the beginning and is intrigued more and more, as the denouement approaches. The crime is committed within the first seven chapters, and, therefore, much more attention is drawn to its consequences.<br><br>
                    
                    Another major character in the novel is Sonechka Marmeladova who became a prostitute in order to save her family from starvation. At first, Rodion considers Sonya a sacrifice out of necessity. He does not see the difference between his sin and hers. Raskolnikov wanted to transgress a law, to become extraordinary. He failed because he was doing it for self-affirmation. Sonya had to trespass against the law of morality, and she succeeded, she withstood the struggles that come with it, ruined her life to save the lives of her loved ones. Endless empathy leads her to the people, while Raskolnikov, on the contrary, alienates himself from society out of his self-centred idea.<br><br>
                    
                    In the end Sonya helps Raskolnikov find truth among all the thoughts that torture him. Raskolnikov embraces his human nature, admits that going against morality is killing him more that any social punishment ever could, he wants to join other people again, who he had consistently alienated himself from until now. He turns himself in and serves his sentence in hard labour, and Sonya goes with him. And then he finally finds peace.</p>
